# Hi there, I'm Lorenzo Mignini 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm an Odoo Developer with an unusual background — before diving into ERP development, I spent years working in **logistics, retail management, and healthcare**. That experience taught me how businesses actually work from the inside, and it's what drives me to build ERP solutions that are practical, not just technically correct.

In 2025 I made a deliberate career pivot: I completed an intensive **6-month Odoo development training at Technocité** (Apr–Oct 2025), covering Python, PostgreSQL, XML/QWeb, OWL/JS, and Git. I'm now **interning at SoWhat! Studio** (Silver Odoo Partner), where I work on real business workflows using **Odoo Studio** and **Odoo.sh**.

- 🌍 Based in **Ath, Wallonia, Belgium**
- 🔍 **Open to work** — looking for my first role as an **Odoo Developer** in Belgium or abroad (especially **Italy, Luxembourg, France, and Switzerland**)
- 💡 Hybrid profile: I bridge the gap between **technical development** and **functional business understanding**

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🚗 [bestcar_management](https://github.com/migninilorenzo/bestcar_management)

A car dealership management system built as the final project of my Technocité training. The goal was to simulate a real business need: managing a vehicle fleet and customer relationships entirely within a custom Odoo module.

**What it does:**
- Vehicle and customer lifecycle management
- Custom Odoo views and business logic
- QWeb templates for reporting
- PostgreSQL-backed data model

**What I learned:** Structuring a complete Odoo module from scratch, writing reusable QWeb templates, and managing the relationship between business logic and the ORM layer.

`Python` `Odoo` `PostgreSQL` `QWeb`

## 🔨 What I'm Working On

At SoWhat! Studio, I'm currently:
- Building **Odoo Studio customizations** for SME clients — adapting views, automations, and workflows to fit real operational needs
- Working with **Odoo.sh** for deployment and version management in a production environment
- Developing custom modules in Python/XML for business-specific requirements
- Strengthening my **functional + technical hybrid profile** to handle both client-facing analysis and backend development
